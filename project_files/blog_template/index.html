			<h1>Motivation</h1>
			Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water. Prior to the 15th century, the ocean
			posed a barrier between the various socieities of the world. Humanity's ability to traverse the ocean was
			the tipping point of recent history, as disparate geographies were now acessible to each other. Trade of
			spices, cultures, and ideas between foreign lands has ushered in an era of globalization that shapes
			every aspect of our lives today.
			<br><br>
			The ocean still has potential to continue revolutionizing life on Earth. In the face of growing climate
			crises, wave energy could serve as a new source of renewable energy. Wave energy is much more reliable, and
			an order of magnitude more powerful than wind energy, according to <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. One vital
			characteristic
			of wave energy is wave height.
			<br><br>
			Beyond renewable energy, wave height plays an important role in commercial shipping, for both boat activity
			<a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>
			as well as port operations <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>. Additionally, water sports like surfing rely on
			accurate predictions of wave
			heights. The global market for surfing is estimated to reach $5.5 billion by 2030 <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>,
			and companies like
			Surfline play a crucial role in the industry by providing surf forecasts.
			<br><br>
			Given the importance of wave heights, many approaches to wave forecasting have been devised. WAVEWATCHCIII
			(Tolman, 1991), a physically-based engineering model, is still widely used in practice today. However,
			WAVEWATCHCIII is
			numerical solver <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>, which are computationally intensive and make assumptions of
			natural
			phenomena.
			<br><br>
			Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to perform wave forecasting, including LSTM <a
				href="#ref9">[9]</a> and transformer based approaches <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>. However, the current
			literature
			considers the forecasting task for a single buoy, given the previous data from that buoy. Since wave energy
			travels
			throughout the ocean,
			it is reasonable to assume that past wave data from nearby locations will be relevant to the prediction
			task. This project
			explores the impact of providing the model with data from nearby buoys for the prediction task of wave
			height.
			<br><br>
			Luckily for researchers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the US
			Department
			of commerce, collects data on ocean condititions from buoys stationed around the world. Using this data, I
			train a transformer-based
			neural network to predict wave heights. I modify the standard transformer architecture by utilizing custom
			dataset generation logic,
			which allows for the inclusion of wave data from nearby, offshore buoys to provide additional context to the
			prediction task at nearshore locations.

			<h1>Data</h1>
			The dataset is collected from the <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric
				Administration (NOAA)</a>. The NOAA stations buoys around the world that collect data on wave factors. A
			full
			description of the data can be found <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/faq/measdes.shtml">at the data
				description here</a>.
			<br><br>
			<h4>Data Preprocessing</h4>
			The data is recorded at the minute level for the year 2023. To reduce the complexity of the dataset, and to
			avoid
			exceedingly large context windows, I convert the data to hourly samples by taking the last record for each
			hour. The data also contains missing values, which are encoded as "999" or some value with 9's in each
			digit.
		</div>
		<div class="margin-right-block">
			It is easy to discern that these are missing values, and not actual observations of 99. Examples are columns
			of wind directions,
			which are on a scale of 0-360. For missing records where a value of "999" would be feasible, like
			atmospheric pressure,
			digits are added so that it's "9999", for instance.
			<br><br>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-margin-container" id="">
		<div class="margin-left-block">
		</div>
		<div class="main-content-block">
			After dropping the missing values, we are left with:
			<ul>
				<li>Wave Height</li>
				<li>Dominant Wave Period</li>
				<li>Average Wave Period</li>
				<li>Wave Direction</li>
				<li>Water Temperature</li>
			</ul>
			Within the columns we keep, there are still additional missing values that are randomly dispersed throughout
			the dataset.
			These missing values are also encoded as "999" or some value with 9's in each digit. These differences can
			actually be
			observed, and boxplots of the data distribution <a href="#data-distr-before-imp">before imputation</a> and
			<a href="#data-distr-after-imp">after imputation</a> are shown in the appendix. We can see that the
			Topanga buoy has outlier values of 9999 for wave direction. Additionally, while it is harder to see due to
			the scale,
			there are also outliers for wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. While values of 99
			are not technically impossible,
			the fact that these outliers occur at exact values of 99 indicates that they are likely truly missing. These
			random missing values
			are imputated according to the mean of a rolling average from a window of 10 hours before and after the
			missing value.
			<h4>Data Exploration</h4>
			For the rest of the analysis, we are interested in predicting wave height. To understand the
			form of the target
			variable, a plot of wave height data from the Topanga buoy in the month of January 2023 is shown below:
			<br><br>
			<img src="./images/plots/topanga_height.png" alt="Topanga Height Data" id="topanga-height"
				style="width: 70%;">
			<br><br>
			There is a fair amount of periodicity, as well as some variability with seasons, such as a large spike
			in wave height at the start of January. This tracks relatively well with intuition, as swell waves are
			generated by storms throughout the Pacific Ocean during the winter months. <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>

			<h1>Architecture</h1>
			The proposed algorithm begins with the dataset generator. Prior work on wave height prediction considers the
			canonical
			forecasting task --- given a stream of consecutive data realizations indexed by time, use previous
			realizations
			to predict future values <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Formally, they seek a function $f^*(\cdot)$ that produces
			predictions
			$\hat{Y^*}$ given a time-indexed sequence of data $X_n$. $$f^*(X_t | X_{t-w},
			X_{t-w+1}, ... X_{t-1}) = \hat{Y^*_t}$$
			for context window size $w$. The function is optimal in the sense that it produces predictions with minimal
			loss/error: $$f^* = \arg \min_f \mathbb{L}(f(x), y)$$ where $\mathbb{L}$ is a loss function.
			<br><br>
			However, due
			to the nature of ocean currents, we have
			additional
			information that would be relevant to the prediction task --- wave data from nearby buoys. The prediction
			task
			would then become $$f^*(X_t | \{X_{t-w}, X_{t-w+1}, ... X_{t-1}\} \cup \{Z_{t-k-w+1}, Z_{t-k-w+2}, ...
			Z_{t-k}\})
			=
			\hat{Y^*_t}$$
			with $Z$ being the data from the nearby buoy, time lag $k$, and context window size $w$. Theoretically, as
			long as
			Z is not excessively noisy, the additional information should improve the model's predictive power.
			<br><br>
			The assumption that Z is not noisy is reasonable to make. Wave energy travels throughout
			the ocean, and wave energies propagate in predictable ways. For example, the California Current travels
			southward along the
			West Coast of the United States from British Columbia,
			Canada, to the southern tip of California.
			<br><br>
			In our dataset, we utilize a more readily observable oceanic phenomenon --- the flow of water towards the
			shore,
			creating the waves that make California's beaches famous. The locations of two of the buoys in our dataset
			are
			shown below:
			<br><br>
			<img src="./images/leucadia_oceanside_buoys.png" alt="Leucadia and Oceanside Buoy Locations"
				style="width: 65%;">
			<br><br>
			The dataset generator takes in data from two buoys --- one offshore, and one nearshore. The
			generator produces $(\text{nearshore data}, \text{offshore data}, \text{target})$ triplets. Becuase the
			number
			of FLOPs grows quadratically with the size of the context window in the attention mechanism, we restrict the
			"context"
			(number of trailing timesteps before target) to be 24 --- since our data is sampled every hour, the model
			has access
			to the previous 24 hours worth of data when generating a prediction of wave height.
			<br><br>
			I also include an
			additional parameter
			<i>k</i>, to control the time lag between the offshore and nearshore buoys. To understand the function of
			<i>k</i>, consider an
			offshore buoy that is very far from the
			nearshore. The slice of the offshore buoy's data should be adjusted to account for the time that it takes
			for the wave
			energy to travel from the offshore buoy to the nearshore buoy. Formally, we provide training samples to the
			model in the form of
			$$(\text{nearshore data}[t-24:t-1], \text{offshore data}[t-k-24:t-k-1], \text{target}[t])$$

		</div>
		<div class="main-content-block">
			<br><br>
			From this definition, we can see that increasing <i>k</i>, the time lag, will result in the model being
			trained on older slices of
			offshore buoy data. In our hypothetical example above, higher <i>k</i> would allow the model to access
			offshore
			buoy data that
			is relevant to the prediction task.
			<br><br>
			The model itself consists of an initial linear embedding layer, two multi-head attention layers, and
			a linear output layer. Both the nearshore and offshore data are passed through a separate transformer block,
			mean pooled, and concatenated. The concatenated data is passed through a final linear layer to produce the
			prediction. I train the model for 15 epochs, batch size 128, and learning rate 0.001. A diagram of the
			architecture is shown below
			<br><br>
			<img src="./images/plots/architecture.drawio.png" alt="Model Architecture" style="width: 65%;">
			<br><br>
			The introduction of the new parameter <i>k</i> creates a natural question --- how should we choose the value
			of <i>k</i>?
			In this project, I take a simple approach and performs a search over a few reasonable values of <i>k</i>,
			and choose the model
			with the best performing <i>k</i>. Values of <i>k</i> come from a set of candidate values $[1, 12, 24, 48,
			168]$. The construction of our training data means that for $k = 48$, the prediction task for time $t$ will
			utilize offshore buoy data
			from 2 days prior, with a 24-hour context window.
			<br><br>
			I use the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, and to judge the marginal value of providing data
			from offshore buoys, I compare against a model in the canonical forecasting task: predicting the value of
			wave height
			at the nearshore buoy at time $t$ given data from the buoy at times $[t-24, t-23, ... t-1]$.
		</div>
		<div class="margin-right-block">
			One alternative approach to choosing <i>k</i> would be to separate the training process into two stages
			---
			the
			first
			to identify the optimal <i>$k^*$</i>, and the second to train the model using $k^*$. In the first stage,
			$k^*$ could be identified by defining a $\delta-$neighborhood around an initially random choice of $k$,
			so
			that
			we train on $\delta$ values of $k$, choosing the value of $k$ with the minimum MSE on a validation set. The
			periodicity
			of ocean movement means that the loss landscape will have many local minima, each with less predictive
			power. It may make sense
			to initialize the search for $k^*$ with smaller <i>k</i>'s to avoid local minima from previous ocean
			periods.

			<h1>Results</h1>
			Results of training for the LA buoys (Santa Monica, Topanga) and SD buoys (Leucadia, Oceanside) are shown
			below:
			<br><br>
			<h4>Training Loss Curve for Leucadia (y-axis is MSE loss, x-axis is step)</h4>
			<img src="./images/plots/leucadia_train.png" alt="leucadia_train" style="width: 65%;">
			<br><br>
			<h4>Training Loss Curve for Topanga (y-axis is MSE loss, x-axis is step)</h4>
			<img src="./images/plots/topanga_train.png" alt="topanga_train" style="width: 65%;">
			<br><br>
			For the Topanga buoy, the model with $k=168$ (7 days) achieves the lowest training loss at 0.053.
			When tested on a validation set, the model with $k=12$ achieves the lowest training loss, with
			0.054. For the Leucadia buoy, the model with $k=1$ achieves both the lowest training loss
			and validation loss at 0.111 and 0.114, respectively.
			<br><br>
			The results indicate that the Topanga buoy depends differently on the offshore buoy data than the Leucadia
			buoy. Interestingly,
			despite the Topanga buoy being closer to its offshore buoy (11.74 miles vs. 12.15 miles), the optimal time
			lag $k=12$ hours for Topanga, while
			it's only 1 hour for Leucadia.
			What is the cause of this discrepancy? Looking at the
			buoy locations plotted below, we can see that the orientation of the nearshore buoys relative to the
			offshore buoys are different.

			<br><br>
			Recalling the southward flow of the California Current, we can see that the Leucadia buoy is in the direct
			path
			of ocean flows, whereas the Topanga buoy is not --- in fact, the Topanga buoy is <i>above</i> the Santa
			Monica Bay buoy. However,
			the ocean flows through Santa Monica Bay can still propagate towards the Topanga buoy, due to the formation
			of eddies, which
			can be caused by wind effects, instabilities in ocean currents, and differences in water temperatures and
			densities. Eddies, along with coastal topographies like the Palos Verdes Pensinsula create the phenomenon
			known as the Southern California Counter Current --- a northward flow that opposes the direction of the
			California
			Current. Naturally, this indirect path means that the wave energies from the Santa Monica Bay
			will take longer to reach the Topanga buoy, as reflected by larger time lags $k$. Intererstingly, our
			model has learned to pick up on this relationship through the flexible context window for offshore data.
			This indicates that even buoys which lie outside the typical flow of current could be helpful in predicting
			wave heights.
			<br><br>
			The key question is
			whether using offshore buoy data actually improves the model's performance. Below, we compare the model's
			validation loss when trained on both offshore and nearshore buoy data versus just nearshore buoy data:

					<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.06</td>

			<br><br>
			The results show a slight improvement in MSE by adding offshore data. One interesting extension to consider
			would be to add
			more buoys to the dataset, and see if model prediction is benefitted by context from other locations.

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			In this analysis, we explored the potential of using offshore buoy data to improve wave height predictions
			at nearshore locations. Our findings suggest that incorporating offshore data leads to slight improvements
			in
			validation loss, or equivalently, prediction accuracy in terms of MSE. Promisingly, there is indication that
			the model gains predictive capacity depending on the relevance of the time-slice of data from the offshore
			buoy that we provide.
			The notions of "relevance" corresponds to what we might believe to be intuitively true, as discussed when
			considering the
			much larger time lag for the Topanga buoy due to counter currents.
			<br><br>
			While the improvements in prediction accuracy are relatively small, the approach lends itself well to
			extension based on
			additional data from neighboring buoys. The NOAA data is quite comprehensive, and many buoys have nearby
			buoys in a multitude
			of directions. Additionally, an approach to making the time-lag parameter <i>k</i> optimizable was
			discussed.
