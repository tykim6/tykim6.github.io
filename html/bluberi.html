  <div class="project-description">
    my first internship was a month long, and I did data analytics work for a
    small gaming vendor in Las Vegas. this was my first chance at playing
    around with the python data analysis libraries (pandas, seaborn,
    matplotlib), and my first experience with machine learning (k-means
    clustering). while this document was mainly for my use as a reflection,
    the head of the analytics department liked it so much he ended up using
    it as training material for incoming analytics new-hires.
