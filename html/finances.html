  <div class="project-description">
    as a college student, I've found it's nearly impossible to make a budget
    without missing out on doing spontaneous things with your friends. this
    left me with two options: become a penny-pinching hermit who carefully
    apportions their 3 months worth of summer internship savings, or abandon
    the budget altogether. a nice middle ground that works for me is looking
    backwards at my purchasing the last week/month/etc. this ensures some
    oversight of my spending, without constraining myself to a budget. i
    created a simple tool to visualize all my statement transactions in a bar
    graph. the app runs a streamlit instance and populates them with Plotly
    histograms.
