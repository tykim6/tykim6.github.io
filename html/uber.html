        this is a research paper I wrote for my economics class. it is an econometric
        analysis of the impact of Uber's entry on the air quality
        in US cities. I used Uber entry data and AQI data from the EPA, as well as
        a difference-in-difference estimation that captures treatement effect
        heterogeniety using STATA.
