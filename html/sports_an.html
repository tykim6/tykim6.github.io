  <p class="project-description">
    i collaborated with some friends on a group project for a
    class, 15.285 (Sports Strategy and Analytics). We decided
    to model a baseball hitter's decision of which pitch to "sit on"
    (guessing what the pitcher is going to throw) as an algorithm that
    takes as input a hitter's success against different pitches and a pitcher's
    liklihood of throwing those pitches, to output a decision of which pitch
    to "sit on".
